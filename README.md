Object:

Be the last player to have a corner of your dollar that is not folded.

Setup:

Each player is dealt 4 cards face down.  You can look at any two of them.  This will be the last time you are allowed to look at your cards.

Play:

On your turn you can take one of three actions.

1) Draw the top card off the top of the draw pile.  You can either discard this card or keep it and discard one of the cards in your hand.

2) Draw the top card off the top of the discard pile.  You must exchange this card with one of the cards in your hand.

3) Knock.  When you knock you indicate that you think you have fewer points in your hand than at least one other player.  When a player knocks,
    every other player gets one more turn to try and improve their hand then scores are compared.

Hand Scoring:

Scores are tallied after the completion of a knock action or if there is no card available for a player in the draw pile when it is their turn.

Hands are totaled with cards being value as below:
Jacks - 0 points
All other face cards - 10 points
Aces - 1 point
All numbered cards - face value

Game Scoring:

Each player starts the game with a one dollar bill in front of them.  As long as the player has at least one corner that is not folded, they are
still in the game.  Once all four corners are folded though, that player forfeits their dollar and is out of the remainder of the game.

If you are the player with the HIGHEST total hand score after they are tallied, you fold one of the corners on your dollar.  If a player knocks and
ends up with the highest total, that player folds two corners.

The last player in the game that has an unfolded corner gets to keep all the dollars!
